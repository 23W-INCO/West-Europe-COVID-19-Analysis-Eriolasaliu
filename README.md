# COVID-19 Analysis: West Europe Choropleth Map

## Description
This project analyzes the spread of COVID-19 in West European countries (Germany, France, Belgium) and creates a Choropleth map to visualize the distribution of cases and mortality rates. The project uses COVID-19 data and GeoJSON information to provide insights into the impact of the pandemic in these specific regions.

## Key User Groups

- Data analysts
- Researchers in epidemiology and public health
- Individuals interested in understanding COVID-19 trends in West Europe

## User Objectives

- Explore and analyze COVID-19 data for Germany, France, and Belgium.
- Visualize the geographic spread of COVID-19 cases and mortality rates in West European countries.
- Gain insights into the correlation between healthcare metrics and COVID-19 impact.

## Visualization using a Choropleth map

The project includes a Choropleth map (`fgb-countries-covid-map.html`) that visually represents the COVID-19 situation in West European countries. The map is created using Folium libraries, offering an interactive and informative view of the pandemic's impact (`location`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred`, `population`).

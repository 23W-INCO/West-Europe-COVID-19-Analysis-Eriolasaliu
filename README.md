# West-Europe-COVID-19-Analysis
This project analyzes the spread of COVID-19 in West European countries (Germany, France, Belgium) and creates a Choropleth map to visualize the distribution of cases and mortality rates. The project uses COVID-19 data and GeoJSON information to provide insights into the impact of the pandemic in these specific regions.
